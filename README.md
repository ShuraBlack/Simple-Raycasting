# Simple-Raycasting
Java based Raycasting rendering inspired by "The coding Train" (no special Libaries needed)
=====================================================
Code written: [Ronny Klotz](https://github.com/ShuraBlack)

Raycasting is a more simple version of the often used raytracing and describe a process which scannes (in this example a 2D space) a scene. In this simple version the scanning will end after hitting the first/nearest object in the path of they ray.
